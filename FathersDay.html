<body><h1>My Dad isn’t Really Honest</h1>
<br>
<p class="summary">So, I’ve been thinking for a while… about the saying that goes “Our dads are never honest”, telling us that our dads aren’t really that straightforward when it comes to our family’s wellbeing. As the breadwinner of the family, a lot of responsibilities come in hand, and one of those is being the cool role model of the family, the one who’s big, strong and can protect you at all costs. 
Even though it looks like it, our father, dad, papa, tatay, is still human, still a mortal being, that can get hurt, feel tired, burn out, or even sometimes, straight out snap at us. But we should always know deep in our hearts, that even if he may shout at us, punish us for our behavior and call us names, they still love us from the bottom of their hearts. Sticks and stones may break bones, electricity may flow through their bones, with a heart of steel and soul of gold, our dad makes sure we reach all of our goals. He will be with us through hardships, fun times, sad times, moments when we are broken and moments where we are complete. He’s the role model that gives us hope, fills us with energy, motivates us to keep doing better, and most importantly, is always there when you need a helping hand.
	They look tough, but inside they’re still get hurt. They may be strict, but deep down it develops us to be better. You are as precious to them as they are precious to their own parents. So in regards to my own dad, I hope you live on and on full of pride and strength, you deserve it. Happy Father’s Day to all dads out there!

<h1>Filipino Dads are Built Different</h1>
	<br>
	<p class="summary">What do I mean? Our dads are different than every one else’s. They’re literally built to withstand all concrete barriers that they face in today’s society, everything they do that they do for you, has a certain level of difficulty they accomplished through sheer will and effort, specifically just for you. Can we just talk about how Filipino dads are pure muscle men? Kahit sobrang laki ng tyan ng tatay mo, kayang buhatin ang sako ng bigas, o kaya, kayang bugbugin ang buong barangay nyo. I mean, whatever you can think of doing, he has the ability to make it true most of the time. Ang mga tatay natin ay mga madidiskarteng tao, like, I couldn’t even think of the many things my dad has invented to fix things at home. Our dad will always be a dad, act like a dad, feel like a dad, and most importantly, look like a dad.
