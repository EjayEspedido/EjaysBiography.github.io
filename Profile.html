<p> &nbsp I was born as an only child in the lovely hands of my mother, Joy Mae S. Duyag, and my father, Joseph G. Espedido, in the <u><b class="profilist">Land of Two Holy Mosques</b></u> commonly known as <b class="profilist">Saudi Arabia</b>. (I am a Roman Catholic) <br><br>
&nbsp I spent most of my childhood days indoors playing video games and learning how to use the computer, in the state of <b class="profilist">Jizan, Saudi Arabia</b>. <br><br>
&nbsp The first school I went to was <b class="profilist">Al- Maarefah International School</b> and I had lots of memories in that school, simply because it was my childhood school and where I learned
most of the things that I know to this day.
&nbsp Being one of the only South East Asian student in the crowd was one of the weirdest feelings that I had while I was there. People mostly looked at me weird but sometimes
other students can be rude and discriminate unintentionally. <br><br>
&nbsp Other than school the only thing I had was my laptop, where I learned how to play games and keep myself busy even on busy days, we could say I was a bit addicted but when it came
to studying, I did my best to balance out everything that I needed and to keep myself happy and satisfied in the process. <br><br>
&nbsp When I moved here in the Philippines, it was a very weird feeling, cause I was the only super chubby and super quiet student that would only talk if he found someone to have the same awkward feeling around
new people and that was when I was 14. <br><br>
&nbsp Now that I am 17 years old. I have learned to do many things and discover many new skills that I have never even thought about having when I was a kid, and I am proud of each and 
every accomplishment I have had in the past 5 years. And I'm still looking forward to what life has in store for me and that is the reason why I am thankful for each moment I have in my life
