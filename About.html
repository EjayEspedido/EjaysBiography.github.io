<H4> Just in case most of what I can say cannot fit on the profile section I'll say it here instead ᗒ ͟ʖᗕ </H4>
<p> Ever since I was a kid I had already been fond of using computers, I learned how to use one at 8 years old which isn't even impressive but since then I've just been
hooked to using computers. It came to the point that I was already getting scolded for getting low grades than average cause I learnt how to play
video-games ୧⪨~⪩୨. But now I've got it all under control. I have fought with my video game addiction and have started playing sports like Badminton and Cycling
outside through the breeze (⌐■_■). I have a few friends whom I really like to be around with: Audrey, Ezekiel, Ivan, Arvin, Mar, Kim and a few more others
that I'd rather not mention hehe, they're all special to me anyways ^_^.
